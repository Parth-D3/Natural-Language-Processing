Urban golf, also known as crossgolf[1][2] or street golf,[3] is a game based on the original game of golf in which individual players or teams hit a ball into a hole or at a specified target using various clubs.

Urban golf is played without a traditional golf course, instead using street furniture as obstacles and targets.[4] Instead of a standard golf ball, players may use leather balls,[5] plastic golf balls, or tennis balls.[3] It may be played on the street as well as in industrial brownfields, sand pits,[2] parks,[6] rooftops, and river banks, among others.[1]
